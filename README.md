# RAWM
The official project of the Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM) method for continual learning

## The code is based on the official code of the CLEAR benchmark

This project include the RAWM and OWM method mentioned in our paper, both of them are (re)produced by us.

The data preparation, training, and testing command is as same as that in the official code of the CLEAR benchmark, and we will update them in future.
